## Players Application that allows them to Create | Update | Delete training sessions and post Reviews.

Dynamic First Touch application allows for Football players (soccer) the ability to create their own account and sign up for training sessions in their account. The app has loaded available sessions that they can sign up for. They will have the ability to delete any training sessions they have entered into their account as well as update.

Naturally, having reviews of the training sessions would be a feather in the cap as long as the coaching maintains the Dynamic in all that they do. Doing so allows for the players to put in a positive review on our sessions and that will help generate more visists and coahing sessions being signed up!

* Create their own Dynamic Training Sessions based on availability
* Update their Dynamic Training Sessions 
* Delete their Dynamic Training Sessions
* Ability for the player to leave a review for others to see how we are doing
